# How to Contribute 
## Steps to add yourself as the contributer to the [SuperUser](https://github.com/SanjeevStephan/superuser) Repository.

1) You will first need git which you can download from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

2) Now go to [this link here](https://github.com/SanjeevStephan/superuser) and click on the `fork` button (located on the top-right corner)

3) On the next page you will see a `create fork` button, press it.

4) You will land on your forked repo page (which basically means you own the copy of this repository & can make any changes you want without interfering the **main branch** , here you will see a `<> Code` button marked in green, click on it and copy the url.

5) Open your terminal and navigate to the **Users's home directory** which is `(C:\Users\<you-username>\Documents)`

6) Now type ``git clone <paste the url you just copied>`` and press enter.

6) Now you will see a folder named `SuperUser`, renamed it to `PowerShell` 

7) Use VScode (code editor) to edit the codes, which you can [download from here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

8) Now save your changes and exit the code-editor, type `git add .`, afterwards `git commit -m "<your name> üçâ"` and lastly `git push origin master`.

9) Go to your forked repo page, `sync` your fork and then there you will see a button in green which says `Open pull request`, press it and in the comments section type "Adding my name to contributer list" and press on `create pull request`.

10) You have created a pull request, wait for a member to review and merge it : )

Lastly,I would encourage to take part in open-source contributions, to learn more about them check this blog [here](https://dragon2002.hashnode.dev/git-and-github-must-know-guide#heading-setting-up-github).
